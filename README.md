What is a Hamburger menu?
A hamburger menu, also known as a three-line menu, is a button with three horizontal lines stacked vertically. It's a common element in modern mobile and web UI designs. Nicknamed for the menu icon that hides options, keeping things tidy on screens.

This space-saving menu button collapses a navigation panel containing app options. It's crucial for responsive design, offering easy access to features on smaller screens without cluttering the main UI.
This repository contains a sample WPF desktop application (.NET 6) demonstrating the implementation of a modern Hamburger Menu using MahApps.Metro, a popular UI library for WPF applications. I have used the open-source MahApps.Metro UI framework.
